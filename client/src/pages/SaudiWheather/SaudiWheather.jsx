            With a wide range of terrains — from mountains to deserts to beaches
            — it’s not surprising that Saudi’s weather is also diverse. And
            while certain generalities apply, there are important differences
            between regions to consider when planning a visit to Arabia. Here
            are answers to some of the most frequently asked climate-related
            questions.

            Makkah, known for being the holiest city in Islam, is also the
            hottest city in Saudi. In summer, temperatures sometimes top 48

            Does it Snow in Saudi?

          <div className="text-color-search" style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>
            Yes; in fact, a big storm that traveled across Europe in early 2020
            led to snowfall in the desert near Tabuk, about 190 kilometers
            northwest of the Red Sea. But even absent such meteorological
            events, snow is not uncommon in Saudi during winter, particularly in
            the mountains of the northern regions.

          <div className="text-color-search" style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>
            Riyadh, the capital, is located in the center of the country, at 600
            meters above sea level. From December to February, the weather is
            mild. In summer, it almost never rains, and the temperatures are
            very high, around 44 degrees C — although the relative humidity is
            low. “I was there in December, and it was incredibly hot during the
            day, despite a gentle breeze. But we went to the desert at night,
            and it was really chilly. We put on light down jackets and drank
            copious amounts of tea to keep warm!” reports Hande Oynar, an
            American writer who worked in Riyadh.
